# Animated CSS Solar System 

This project contains an HTML and CSS file for a responsive animated Solar System.

## Responsiveness

### Desktop
Within the desktop viewing parameters the following can be seen:
* Planets
    * Orbital pattern
* Moons
    * Orbital pattern
* Different speeds


### Mobile
Within the mobile viewing parameters the following can be seen:
* Planets
    * Orbital pattern
* Different speeds

The following have been hidden due to the constraints of the screen:

* Moons
    * Orbital pattern

## Issues

* For the moment, for best results viewing the desktop version at 4k settings shows the entirety without jumping off the page.

* Dragging the page between mobile and desktop views might require a browser refresh as the orbit paths and planets do not automatically lineup.

## Future Plans
There are plans to build on this project in the future.  From the responsiveness of the page to the  inclusion of solar flares on the sun and adding javascript to display information about an object on mouse hover, there is alot more needed to do for this project and it should be very exciting.  Below is breakdown of future implementations.

- [ ] Update responsiveness
- [ ] Addition of solar flare to sun
- [ ] Addition of Asteroid belt
- [ ] Add better coloring to planets and moons
- [ ] Change Miranda (Neptune moon) to resemble an animated bubble. 
- [ ] Add JavaScript to display information to objects.

Thank you for taking the time to look over this project. Please let me know your thoughts.
